## Foundry
We want to make a stablecoin that is:
1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
    a. Chainlink price feed
    b. Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
    a. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
    a. wETH
    b. wBTC
